Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 

With a small number of simulations of 10, france having no chance of winnning was incorrect.
With 100 simulations France had an 8% chance of winning so was most correct.
Increased from 1000 simulations onwards the chance of France winning lowered to 3.5%.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 

If charged a fee for each SECOND of compute time the program uses, after 1000 simulations should be "good enough"
